## zkPass-Port

- The traditional passport and visa process is a challenging and tedious task, people with a long travel history have the burden of maintaining multiple passports for the rest of their lives and if they lose even the passport then it's a hassle to get a duplicate copy of it, they need to go through a long government process and if you lose your passport in a foreign country, then it's even a bigger problem, you're locked in that country.

- I decided to digitalise this process and make it less hassle-free by creating a digital passport and attaching a travel history to it, this digital passport can then be submitted to Embassies or Consulates that can then grant an e-visa to the person based on their travel history.

- The user needs to authenticate, fill some basic details, which will then be verified by the government and then a digital passport is generated

- The travel history will be based on Zero-Knowledge, that means third parties can verify the data without exact travel history getting exposed

- This digital passport can be verified on the website, travel history associated with the passport can also be verified and then lastly user can send this passport with their visa application,

- This will enable third parties like embassies and visa centers to verify all the details and an E-Visa instead of a traditional sticker visa, which will then be added to the travel history of the passport holder, this E-Visa entry can be verified by authorities upon arrival in destination country.

- One of the use case can be able to prove you were in particular contry without actually giving in details like date, duration, etc., this will preserve privacy of travellers.
